# Introduction

Hi, my name is Sebastián and this is my try to improve my programming skills through learning from one of the best programmers I've ever seen in the streaming world, ThePrimeagen. Couple of months ago I saw on a webpage that I'm already forget, this course, FREE, yes - totally free. Of course, like a good programmer I take the chance and reclaim as mine, I even create an account on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/) when I never have been use this website. I mean, before I use Coursera or Udemy, but FrontendMasters? Wth is that? Well, now I'm here learning from its course - 'The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need'. I know, it's a really pretentious name for a Algorithms course. Anyway… I want to learn more. Why? Here are my motivations:

- Money
- Become a better programmer
- Expand my logic mentality
- Improve my solving skills
- Gain more weapons to confront competitive programming exercises
- More money, obviously

I consider myself a programmer really lazy, I have to work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but honestly I don't want to waste all my time in development a website which an stupid mechanical method. So I always searching for a better way to do things. Now I have this course and I hope to know how to improve my logic and finally complete a CodeChef contest.

Now, I obviously will complete the course, but just seeing the video and putting in practice would be really boring, I'll complete the course and add more of my own. Doing competitive programming courses, expanding my knowledge through deeper searching in internet and overhealming the IA with questions. Yep, btw I'm now free 'cause I'm finally ends university, so I'll dedicated a lot to this. Come with me to complete this task and become better programmers.

**Disclaimer:** I don't know so much English, so I'll write in a really simple way so I can understand what I'm trying to explaind and as I complete this course I'll also improve this documentation fixing grammatical errors and giving more sense and effort to my explanations and code.

Let's start!!!
