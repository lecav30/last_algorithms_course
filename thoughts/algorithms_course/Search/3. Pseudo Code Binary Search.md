Remind the left and right positions we were checking before? now we'll call them *low* and *high* to bright the idea. The idea is the same, check the middle through the following formula:

$middle = [low + (high - low) / 2]$

Considering:

$[low, high)$

The operation is truly simple:

```
low = 0
high = length(arr)

while low < high:
	mid = [low + (high - low) / 2]
	value = arr[m]
	
	if value == neddle:
		return true
	else if value < neddle:
		low = mid + 1 // right
	else
		high = mid    // left

return false
```
