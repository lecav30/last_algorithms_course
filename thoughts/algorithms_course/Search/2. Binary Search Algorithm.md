Basis for any other algorithm we will encounter.

## Important Considerations

> Is the array sorted?

To avoid just get another `O(n)` complexity time at the time to try to improve our algorithm, we have to take advantage of the new data "the array is sorted". And change the method in order to really get an improve. In this particular case, checking always the middle of the array until we just get one element, the one we were searching about.

To make it clear, if you have an array con first index `0` and last index `n`, you can check first `n/2` and think *Is this element greater or lesser than...* and depending the case take the left mid array or the right mid array. This will change the `O(n)` to `O(log N)`.

You can understand why it's called **binary search** thinking about the just two options the algorithm have to choose before check if it find the objective.
